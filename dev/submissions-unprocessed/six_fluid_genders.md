# Six Fluid Genders

0. he him is deadnouns. I didnt like the expectations, assumptions, and implications.
1. any was fun but actually im just outsourcing my gender.
2. she her was fine but didnt fit good either. More assumptions and expectations.
3. any again was fun but people mostly called me she and occasionally he, and never anything else...
4. but then, an older queer artists who I have a shit ton of respect for told me they had assumed they/them for me... and that felt really right...
5. But only for a while. I feel like they have their own gender ideals built from the negative image of two genders (Man - masculinity = person) So when the default options all got boring: did I reject material desire and attain Nirvana? no! I simply find more material to desire (xe/xir pronouns). surely this will make me happy.
6. damn it/it pronouns got hands
